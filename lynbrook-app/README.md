### 3. Run the project with Expo CLI.

### NOTE!

After running the above command, you will be given the choice to run the project on a couple different emulators. The only two that does work will be iOS or Android. However, before clicking on the ```Run on Android Emulator``` or ```Run on iOS emulator button```, you must set one up yourself!

For an Android Emulator, please see here on how to set them up:
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator

In particular, if using a MacOS, then export ```platform-tools``` and ```emulator``` into your computer so that you can set up an independent Android emulator!

For iOS emulator, please download XCode to set up one. Link here:
